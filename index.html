Plus bas le canal Saint-Martin, ferme par les deux ecluses etalait en ligne droite son eau couleur d'encre. Il y avait au milieu, un bateau plein de bois, et sur la berge deux rangs de barriques. Au dela du canal, entre les maisons que separent des chantiers le grand ciel pur se decoupait en plaques d'outremer, et sous la reverberation du soleil, les facades blanches, les toits d'ardoises, les quais de granit eblouissaient. Une rumeur confuse montait du loin dans l'atmosphere tiede ; et tout semblait engourdi par le desoeuvrement du dimanche et la tristesse des jours d'ete. Deux hommes parurent. L'un venait de la Bastille, l'autre du Jardin des Plantes. Le plus grand, vetu de toile, marchait le chapeau en arriere, le gilet deboutonne et sa cravate a la main. Le plus petit, dont le corps disparaissait dans une redingote marron, baissait la tete sous une casquette a visiere pointue.</p>

                            <p>From the Flap:

                                Roland Deschain and his ka-tet are bearing southeast through the forests of Mid-World, the almost timeless landscape that seems to stretch from the wreckage of civility that defined Roland's youth to the crimson chaos that seems the future's only promise. Readers of Stephen King's epic series know Roland well, or as well as this enigmatic hero can be known. They also know the companions who have been drawn to his quest for the DarkTower: Eddie Dean and his wife, Susannah; Jake Chambers, the boy who has come twice through the doorway of death into Roland's world; and Oy, the Billy-Bumbler.
                                
                                In this long-awaited fifth novel in the saga, their path takes them to the outskirts of Calla Bryn Sturgis, a tranquil valley community of farmers and ranchers on Mid-World's borderlands. Beyond the town, the rocky ground rises toward the hulking darkness of Thunderclap, the source of a terrible affliction that is slowly stealing the community's soul. One of the town's residents is Pere Callahan, a ruined priest who, like Susannah, Eddie, and Jake, passed through one of the portals that lead both into and out of Roland's world.
                                
                                As Father Callahan tells the ka-tet the astonishing story of what happened following his shamed departure from Maine in 1977, his connection to the Dark Tower becomes clear, as does the danger facing a single red rose in a vacant lot off Second Avenue in midtown Manhattan. For Calla Bryn Sturgis, danger gathers in the east like a storm cloud. The Wolves of Thunderclap and their unspeakable depredation are coming. To resist them is to risk all, but these are odds the gunslingers are used to, and they can give the Calla-folken both courage and cunning. Their guns, however, will not be enough.</p>

                            <h2>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</h2>
                            <p>Mark Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is, according to many critics and fond readers, the great American novel. Full of vibrant American characters, intriguing regional dialects and folkways, and down-home good humor, it also hits Americans in one of their greatest and on-going sore spots: the fraught issue of racism. As Huck and Jim float down the Mississippi and encounter all manner of people and situations, and as Huck struggles mightily with his conscience concerning Jim, the novel strongly invites a moral and religious perspective. In this new edition, Mary R. Reichardt’s introduction places the book in its historical and biographical context, and several critical articles examine such issues as the book’s moral implications, religious contexts, and status as an American epic.
